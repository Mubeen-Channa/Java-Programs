Loops are fundamental programming constructs that allow you to execute a block of code multiple times.
They are essential for tasks that require repetition, such as iterating over data structures, performing calculations, or automating repetitive tasks.


Types of Loops
1. For Loop

Synatx:
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to be executed
}

Example:
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to be executed
}


2. While Loop : Used when the number of iterations is not known and depends on a condition.

Syntax:
int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}


3. Do While Loop : Similar to the while loop, but ensures that the code block is executed at least once.

Syntax:
do {
    // code to be executed
} while (condition);

Example:
int i = 0;
do {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 10);


4. For Each Loop: is a simpler way to iterate over elements in an array or a collection. It is particularly useful when you do not need to manipulate the loop counter or the elements directly.

Syntax:
for (type variable : collection) {
    // code to be executed for each element
}

Example:
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int number : numbers) {
    System.out.println(number);
}
